In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of
handwritten images. Weâ€™ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression
to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what
works well and how techniques compare.
